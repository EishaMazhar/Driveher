## Drive(H)er

A Community Transport and Commute Solution Built by Her for Her, with AI-Powered Secure Gender Authentication.

## Inspiration

Female travelers have very different issues and certainly very different risk-management patterns than male travelers might have. Gone are the days of reliance on men for commuting! Females will be driving for females, not as an obligation but to empower each other’s role as students, professionals, or just a woman. Our idea calls for uniting unorganized female carpooling communities on social media platforms and to set them formally for easy usage.

Recent sexual harassment allegations — and past incidents of sexual assault by drivers — have presented challenges for companies like Careem, Uber. Meanwhile, this can be launched with hopes of opening up the industry to more women where they can travel on their own, with females, alongside earning a few bucks.
